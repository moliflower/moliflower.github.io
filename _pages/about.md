Hi, I'm **Yuhan Deng**, a master's student at XXX University and a member of the **Intelligent Computing Laboratory (ICL)**.  

My research focuses on **efficient inference techniques for large language models**, including system-level optimization, CUDA kernel acceleration, FlashAttention, and model quantization.  

I am passionate about **high-performance AI systems** and making large-scale models faster and more memory-efficient.  

You can reach me at: **18870788548@shu.edu.cn**
